    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: December 24, 2025</p>

    <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Photo Swipe Clean's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
        information we may collect from you across our application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Photo Swipe Clean does NOT collect or store your personal photos on any external server.</strong> All
        photo processing, cleaning, and organization happens locally on your device.</p>

    <h3>Local Data</h3>
    <p>We access your photo library solely to provide the functionality of the app (organizing and deleting photos).
        This data never leaves your device.</p>

    <h3>Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We may collect anonymous usage data (such as button taps, screen views) to help us improve the app. This data is
        not linked to your personal identity.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photo Library Usage:</strong> To display your photos for cleaning and organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking (Optional):</strong> To deliver personalized ads (if applicable) or analytics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Security</h2>
    <p>Since we do not store your photos on our servers, your personal memories are as secure as your device itself.</p>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>
