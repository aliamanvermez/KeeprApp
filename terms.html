    <h1>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 25, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
        that you read them carefully before using the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Keepr ("we," "our," or "us") provides a mobile application designed to help users organize and clean their photo
        libraries. By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not
        allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into
        other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights,
        and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to the Keepr App Team.</p>

    <h2>3. Service Changes and Charges</h2>
    <p>Keepr is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve
        the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will
        never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Personal Data and Security</h2>
    <p>The Keepr app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. It’s your
        responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak
        or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
        official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
        programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Keepr app won’t work properly or
        at all.</p>

    <h2>5. Third Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/">Apple Standard EULA</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google Play Terms of Service</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for the photos and videos you delete. While the app moves items to the 'Recently Deleted'
        folder (Trash) initially, permanent deletion is irreversible dependent on your device settings and actions
        inside the Trash folder. We strongly recommend backing up important data.</p>
    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Keepr will not take responsibility for. Information
        handling and network connectivity are subject to your provider's terms.</p>

    <h2>7. Updates and Termination</h2>
    <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for the
        system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and
        you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Keepr does not promise that it will
        always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on
        your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also
        wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to
        you.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically
        for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>

    <h2>9. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current
        period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can
        manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to contact us at
